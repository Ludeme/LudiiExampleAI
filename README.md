This project contains instructions and examples for the implementation of 
third-party AI algorithms / agents for the Ludii general game system. After
developing your own agent, you can load it locally through the GUI of the
Ludii application, and watch it play any game supported by Ludii! 

Agents implemented according to the instructions on this page will also be
suitable for submission to any future agent-based playing competitions
organised using the Ludii system.

Most of the documentation found in this repository may also be found in
the Ludii User Guide, accessible from the 
[Ludii webpage](http://ludii.games/index.php).

We also recommend taking a look at the [Ludii Tutorials](https://ludiitutorials.readthedocs.io)
for tutorials on AI development as well as any other aspects of Ludii, and
[Ludii Python AI](https://github.com/Ludeme/LudiiPythonAI) for implementing AIs using Python.

## Requirements

The **minimum version of Java** required is **Java 8**. 

## Getting Started

### AI Development

1. Download [Ludii's JAR file](http://ludii.games/download.php). This is the
JAR file that can also be used to launch the Ludii application.
2. Create a new Java project using your favourite IDE. You can also create a
fork of this [github repository](https://github.com/Ludeme/LudiiExampleAI)
to get started with some example implementations of basic agents.
3. Make sure to add the Ludii's JAR file downloaded in step 1 as a library for
your project.
4. Any agent that you'd like to implement will have to extend the abstract class
`util.AI`. This contains four methods that may be overridden:
	1. `public Move selectAction(final Game game, final Context context, 
	final double maxSeconds, final int maxIterations, final int maxDepth)`.
	It takes a reference to the `game` being played, and the current 
	`context` (which contains, among other data, the current game state) as
	arguments, and should return the next `Move` to be played by the agent. 
	The final three arguments can be used to restrict the agent's processing
	(its search time, or its maximum iteration count or search depth for example).
	2. `public void initAI(final Game game, final int playerID)`. This method can be used
	to perform any initialisation of the AI when the game to be played has been
	determined, but before the initial game state has been generated. 
	3. `public boolean supportsGame(final Game game)`. This method has a default implementation
	to return `true` for any game, but may be overridden to return `false` for games
	that your agent cannot play. For example, it may be unable to play simultaneous-move
	games, and then be implemented to always return `false` for those. Ludii will then
	know not to try to make your AI play such a game.
	4. `public void closeAI()`. This method can be used to perform any cleanup of resources
	when a game has been finished.
	
    For a simple example class that extends this abstract class, see the 
[Example Random AI](src/random/RandomAI.java).

5. Export your project to a new JAR file.

### Loading AI in the Ludii Application - Programmatically

The [LaunchLudii.java](src/main/LaunchLudii.java) file included in this example repository
demonstrates how you can write your own main method that programmatically launches the
Ludii application (including its graphical user interface), while also registering your
own custom AI implementations such that they can be selected in Ludii's dropdown menus for
agent selection. The code used for this looks as follows:

```java
// Register our example AIs
AIRegistry.registerAI("Example Random AI", () -> {return new RandomAI();}, (game) -> {return true;});
AIRegistry.registerAI("Example UCT", () -> {return new ExampleUCT();}, (game) -> {return new ExampleUCT().supportsGame(game);});
AIRegistry.registerAI("Example DUCT", () -> {return new ExampleDUCT();}, (game) -> {return new ExampleDUCT().supportsGame(game);});
		
// Run Ludii
StartDesktopApp.main(new String[0]);
```
    
Each of the three `AIRegistry.registerAI()` calls registers a custom AI entry for the
dropdown menus in Ludii. In each of these calls, the first argument is the name displayed
in dropdown menus, the second argument is a function that Ludii calls whenever it wishes
to instantiate such an AI object, and the third argument is a function that, for any
give game, tells Ludii whether or not that agent is applicable to that game. For example,
an agent that cannot play simultaneous-move games should return `false` when a simultaneous-move
game is passed into this function. The final line of code simply launches the Ludii application.

### Loading AI in the Ludii Application - From JAR

In the Ludii application, the dialog in which agent types can be assigned to
players can be opened by clicking one of the player names in the GUI, or by
selecting `Ludii > Preferences...` in the menubar. In addition to a
number of built-in agents, the drop-down menus contain a `From JAR` option.

To load your own custom AI implementation into Ludii, export your project
containing it to a new JAR file. Next, select the `From JAR` option, and 
then select the JAR file containing your custom AI's .class file. A dialog 
will appear with all the different classes in the selected JAR file that 
extend Ludii's `util.AI` abstract class, and you will be required to choose 
one of them. Note that this means that it is fine if you have a single JAR 
file containing many different, custom AI implementations; they can all be
loaded.

Ludii will attempt to instantiate an agent of the selected class by calling
a zero-arguments constructor of that class. **This will only work correctly
if your class does indeed provide a zero-args constructor, and it will have
to be public as well!.** After loading it as instructed here, the custom AI
can be used to play any games in the Ludii application, just like any other
built-in AI.

**Note:** while the Ludii application is running, it will only load all the
.class files of any selected JAR file once. If you have already selected a
JAR file once, and then re-build your custom JAR file without changing its
filepath, you will have to close and re-open the Ludii application if you
wish to try loading agents from the modified JAR file.

## Example Agents

- [Random AI](src/random/RandomAI.java).
- [Example UCT](src/mcts/ExampleUCT.java) (only supports deterministic, alternating-move games).
- [Example Decoupled UCT](src/mcts/ExampleDUCT.java) (only supporst deterministic, simultaneous-move games).

## Citing Information

for visual inspections of your agent's behaviour during development, etc.), 
please cite [our paper on the Ludii system](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05013).

## Background Info

This repository contains information and examples for the development of third-
party AI implementations which can be loaded into the Ludii General Game System.
Note that this repository does not contain the full Ludii system, or its
built-in AI options.

This work, as well as the full Ludii system itself, are developed for the
Digital Ludeme Project. More info on the project and the system can be found on:
